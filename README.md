# SSDT_UnitTestingFunctions

**THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Introduction

Having a need to create unit tests for my own SQL Server databases, I found an option at [Walkthrough: Creating and Running a SQL Server Unit Test] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj851212(v=vs.103).aspx). As of today (2018-02-01) the examples on that document only show stored procedures. After figuring out through trial-and-error how to use the SSDT Unit Testing tool for functions, I am sharing a simple "hello world" type of database with simple functions and a walkthrough with many screenshots to clearly illustrate to start with a blank database project and end with a function with a set of unit tests verifying expected output with given inputs.

## Tasks To Do

1. Create blank database project
2. Create table-valued function
3. Create unit tests for that function
4. Create wiki showing step-by-step instructions
5. Create "Lessons learned" wiki
